# My dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles, these are my config files of my setup.

- Qtile (as my window manager)

Currently am using arch linux, and feel free to clone and fork if you want to!

# My Qtile setup
This is my WM setup that I use, based currently on One-Dark colour scheme, using the phinger cursors.
