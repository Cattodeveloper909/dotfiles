# My dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles, these are my config files for desktop setup, being on two enviroments:

- KDE (as my desktop enviroment)
- Qtile (as my window manager)

Currently am using Fedora KDE 35, and feel free to clone and fork if you want to!

## My Qtile setup
This is my WM setup that I use, based currently on One-Dark colour scheme, using the phinger cursors.

## My KDE desktop
This is my new KDE setup based on the Snazzy colour scheme and the Crown-Global theme, using as well the phinger cursors.
